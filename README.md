### Project Overview

It was a regular summer afternoon and I found myself in a predcament situation.
I was setting up my work repository and for that I had to setup a SSH key to be able to push my code to the remote work repository.
Now, though the process of setting up a SSH key is quite simple, and has been document so many times, it wasn't really an issue; I've done it before countless times but I still had to check the documentation just in case because I always forget the exact commands to use since it happens not that regularly.

This wasn't the actual problem though; I already had my personal SSH key setup and now I had another that was associated with work, both were loaded in my SSH agent and I had to switch between them all the time. After a while I was annoyed with it that I have to switch between the SSH keys, remember the exact commands to use, or visit some documentation/GPT to get the commands right.

I though to myself, "There must be a better way to manage SSH keys and connections", the asnwer was to use a config file but I didn't find it elegant enough for my needs. I wanted something that would allow me to easily add, remove, and list SSH hosts without having to manually edit a config file or remember the exact commands.

Hence, `this.ssh` was born.

`this.ssh` is a simple SSH management tool that allows users to manage their SSH connections and configurations easily. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, removing, and listing SSH hosts.
